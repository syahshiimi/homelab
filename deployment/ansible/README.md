# Ansible @ Homelab

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is used to automate the provisioning of base binaries and softwares that is idempotent, reproducible
and fundamentally portable.

## Playbooks
At the core of Ansible are _playbooks_ which are large, units of work target for a specific goal in mind. For instance,
a playbook can defined and used to install necessary packages in all the remote hosts.
